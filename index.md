# What mObywatel is?

The mObywatel application is implemented by the Ministry of Digital Affairs.

This application's goal is to enable the replacement of a plastic ID, driver's license, and other documents with a mobile application.

The main module of the application is mObywatel, meaning the information that can also be found on an ID card (including its number and expiration date). However, it is not equivalent to a physical document - you can use it to confirm your identity at a post office when receiving registered mail, but not at a bank or notary.

Moreover, students can keep their school IDs and student card in the mObywatel application. Drivers can use the mPojazd module which displays information from the registration card of the (co-)owned vehicle and information about the mandatory third party insurance.

A feature such as eRecepta (thanks to it, you do not have to say your PESEL in a pharmacy each time at the counter to protect your privacy) and mPrawo Jazdy module with a function to check the number of penalty points.

Moreover, mObywatel offers the module Polak za granicÄ… (you can check information about countries around the world that you should know before traveling) and Koronawirus - informator.

To sum up, thanks to this application, the user can:  

ðŸ‘‰  securely download and show their data  
ðŸ‘‰  process eRecepta without entering the PESEL number  
ðŸ‘‰  store confirmation of COVID-19 vaccination  
ðŸ‘‰  validate acquired driving privileges  
ðŸ‘‰  check penalty points  
ðŸ‘‰  show and check car data  
ðŸ‘‰  use school or student identity card  

The user can activate the mObywatel and download data from the Register of Personal Identity Cards and the PESEL register on no more than three smartphones. One smartphone may activate the mObywatel application and download data from the Register of Personal Cards and the PESEL register of only one user.
